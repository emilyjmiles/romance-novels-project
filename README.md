<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Romance Book Cover Generator is an application that helps take the stress out of creating a book cover for your romance novel. It randomly generates a cover image, title, and tagline for you, with just a click of a button. Still having trouble deciding? You can also save covers to review later or use the "Create My Cover" form to customize your own cover. Once you decide on the cover for your next bestselling book, you can delete any other saved book covers by double clicking on the cover in your "View Saved Covers" section.

The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/romcom-pair.html)

<!-- REFLECTIONS -->

## Reflections

This was the first collaborative project we were given as students at Turing and learning to navigate that dynamic was difficult at times. Despite some scheduling hiccups, our team made sure to make communictation and understanding our top priorities. This project collaboration was a very rewarding experience and it was wonderful to be able to see and discuss our thought processes on how to accomplish the project goal.

### Wins:
- Being able to successfully complete every iteration of the project spec.
- Understanding what each piece of code was doing and when it was doing it, that both teammates wrote.

### Challenges:
- Learning to collaborate on a team with someone who works and learns differently than myself.
- Scheduling time to work together around our busy Turing curriculum and personal lives.
